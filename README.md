# Collatz-plot

Released under the GNU GPL.

Small Python-scatch I've created for one of my upcoming 
Drum & Bass-EPs for MarcRenton.com

## Usage
1. Import all files into your environment. I recommend 
using venv or an IDE like Pycharm
2. Install matplot & numpy

- **collatz_print.py:** This is the main file that will print the main polot
scratch_collatz
- **sine-print.py:** Not used plot of a sine-wave. 
For my cover I've chosen another wave-sample of a famous Drum & Bass-break.
